            <b>Data annotation</b> is the process of labeling data to make it understandable for machine learning and it’s utmost necessary to have accurate sets for Machine Learning. 
            Data annotation, an important step of data preprocessing in supervised learning. 
            Machine Learning (ML) dictates a new approach to business – one that requires plenty of data. 
            Data annotation is done to create the training data sets for AI and ML while image annotation is a very important type of annotation. 
            A task of marking and outlining objects and entities on an image and offering various keywords to classify it which is readable for machines.
