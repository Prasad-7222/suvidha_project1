Applications of Video & Motion Tracking:

The primary purpose of video and motion tracking is to capture objects of interest frame-by-frame, making them recognizable to machines. This technology provides autonomous vehicles with the detailed visual perception necessary to identify various objects, including pedestrians, street lights, signboards, traffic lanes, signals, cyclists, and other vehicles on the road. Learning Spiral's video annotation services ensure the delivery of precise data, essential for training self-driving cars and enhancing their ability to navigate roads safely and efficiently.</p>
