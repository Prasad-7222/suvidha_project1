          <h3>Video Annotation</h3>
          <p>
            To help machine learning models accurately understand images and videos, video annotation is crucial for autonomous vehicles. For models to effectively perform tasks like image and video recognition, this process is essential to training. To train these models, data scientists need accurate annotations of the data, which acts as the ground truth. Automatic vehicle systems' dependability and efficiency are directly impacted by the caliber and volume of annotated data. Accurate and extensive annotation is therefore essential for the creation of safe and effective autonomous driving technologies.
